### The 'How to finalize your Github repository list'...

### 27 August 2022, I try to take breaks regularly and actually go for a walk around the block , taking about 10 minuites. I leave the campus, climb
the stairway up to the Terrace, left along to a building and down to lampton quay and left back to the campus.

### Timeboxing is something that I have not heard of before. It seems to be around dedicating a period of time for a task and adapting the task to fit within
the timeframe selected, rather than increasing the time frame to complete the task. Timeboxing is an Agile programing method. Or a time period is dedicated 
for a task and then work on that task stops no mater if the task has been completed or not, then a review is completed to decide on how to proceed.

### I am Zero confident with each of the assignments.

### I have nothing to be proud of particularly , up to this point in the course.

### My learning strategy has been to try to link the information I have to learn with things I'd like to do. But that does not seem to work most of the time 
because the information i have to learn in this course IT 5016 and IT5012 is quite overwhelming and can impact negatively on the reasons i might of had
for doing this course in the first instance. Basically if i enjoy learning something like reading a book, then I find it easier than learning somethings
i don't find enjoyable etc. It all revolves around if i can make learnign something enjoyable to motivate the learning of something.

### If I could send myself a text message when I was at the beginning of the course i might say to myself good on you for trying something different.

### Python is. Proceedures can be applied to objects to make them able to be modified. Python is a Object Oriented Programing language. 

### I have developed a habit of exploring - which is one of the reasons I came to Whitecliff in the first place. When someone say starts a polytech course,
suddenly other ideas are presented as the course content is digested. So a person may start a course and then relise that some other subject is more 
interesting and so a person may open that particular door. 

### I have not meditated before per say. I have meet people that recommend i do, however. I do try to go for a walk for at least an hour in nature so to
speak - for example a local coastal walk. I want to do a walk every day but no time. A walk like this could be considered medatative.

### I have never really mastered anything of consequence. Driving a car is a skill i do have. 

### I am in no way a developer yet. I have found anything to do with programing , very difficult in this course - Including SQL.

### I have 15 tabs open right now, in my browser. 11 study related to 4 not study related. 

### Yes I have had a fight response so far around programing languages and SQL. None so far seem to be intuitive. It feels quite bad and sad. Because it 
seems like maybe I choose the wrong thing to study, but it is something that i have  wanted to try, for some years now. The only way to overcome it is 
if it can be made enjoyable somehow.

### An Intergrated Development Environment , is seems like it is a text editor with added web design capabilities. Coincenently, I have been using 'Brackets'
a little bit. But it seems like Adobe have stopped supporting Brackets?

### The Marshmallow challenge...I actually enjoyed the class and left the campus feeling much better. It really has probably been one of the only classes 
at Whitecliffe that I have enjoyed completely. More specifically i found that we needed a few iterations to get the tower right. And there were things that 
could have been done, but were outside of the breif like tieing the top of the tower to the ceiling. And we had to cooperate with each other and move ahead 
with consensus. 

### I did have blocks during the different iterations, but I then waited for input from other team members, which I could then contribute to and 
colaborate with the team on the new iterations. 

### Actually , I have not found many big problems yet in IT5016 Software Deveolopment Fundamentals except for the coding side. The last course i found
SQL very difficult.

### OOP = Object Oriented Programing. There is an object to which data can be applied to it to modify it in some way.

### I am using the 'Canvas' content and I'm up to pages 'ineractive mode programing'. It is helpfull , but I have not been as proactive in progressing 
with the canvas content as I should - partly because i find the actual coding such a challenge.

### Polymorphism = 'many forms/shapes'. Hard to comprehend and explain the programing version; One symbol can represent more than one symbol.

### Yes I heard the voice. But it is more like ' am i doing the right thing studying at Whitecliffe or should I just keep a job and sleep better knowing
my finances would be better?' And i need a lot more time to pick up new things that my brain is not used to doing...

### MVP = Most Valuable player or 'Minimum Viable Product'. The maximum amount of learnign and understanding with the least amount of effort and work.

### I have not managed to solve any hard problems in this course so far.

### Pair Programing = It seems to be when there are two people involved. One person known as the 'Driver' does the actuall coding at the computer, while
the other monitors the code for a more strategic understanding of the overall concept - while the driver can concentrate on the actuall entering of code
into the computer. Roles are swapped frequently between the two. In theory this should increase the efficasy of the code.

### I was looking forward to learning about coding to create web sites. Also interseted in software like APlications. but it is not a quick and one 
person thing. Not sure now.

### Consciuos Listening = It seems to be listening to another person very intently and toally focused on that person and conversation without letting
our brain wander off on some other thought. And also paying particular care to observe the body language of the person speaking and aslo trying not to judge
the other persons converstation with preconcieved judgment etc...

### Variable = A value that can be changed by accompnying parameters?

### I do not really have a preference of what programing language to learn accept for being the language that is best for the situation. But there seems to 
be so many, maybe the best is the language that most browsers and web understands.

### Something kind that someone has done for Me...Letting me hand in my assingments in the last course(IT5012), very late.

### Hard to know what I would say to someone about programing - who knows nothing about it. As i too know very little about programing. One thing is you 
have to spend long hours in front of a computer - which is very hard to do...

### As for doubting my inate ability... This course has not so much made me doubt that, but rather doubt about my motivasation for comming to Whitecliffe.
Rather than taking time out completely for a year or so before comitting to study or work again...

### A Fixed Mindset... is when a person beleives something to be the case and will not entertain any contrary belief... when a person believes and acts
in a way, regardless of evidence and/or advice to suggest the person is wrong in that particular belief.

### A few months back, i gave a begger a $5 note. She was begging not far from the Lampton Quay campus. 

### I have not done mindfulness or attention training before. 

### As for perseverance...I will persevere with something if i can see a reason why. But it is hard to persevere with something with which i have little
motivation.
