### 27 August 2022, I try to take breaks regularly and actually go for a walk around the block , taking about 10 minuites. I leave the campus, climb
the stairway up to the Terrace, left along to a building and down to lampton quay and left back to the campus.

### Timeboxing is something that I have not heard of before. It seems to be around dedicating a period of time for a task and adapting the task to fit within
the timeframe selected, rather than increasing the time frame to complete the task. Timeboxing is an Agile programing method. Or a time period is dedicated 
for a task and then work on that task stops no mater if the task has been completed or not, then a review is completed to decide on how to proceed.

### I am Zero confident with each of the assignments.

### I have nothing to be proud of particularly , up to this point in the course.

### My learning strategy has been to try to link the information I have to learn with things I'd like to do. But that does not seem to work most of the time 
because the information i have to learn in this course IT 5016 and IT5012 is quite overwhelming and can impact negatively on the reasons i might of had
for doing this course in the first instance. Basically if i enjoy learning something like reading a book, then I find it easier than learning somethings
i don't find enjoyable etc. It all revolves around if i can make learnign something enjoyable to motivate the learning of something.

### If I could send myself a text message when I was at the beginning of the course i might say to myself good on you for trying something different.

### Python is. Proceedures can be applied to objects to make them able to be modified. Python is a Object Oriented Programing language. 

### I have developed a habit of exploring - which is one of the reasons I came to Whitecliff in the first place. When someone say starts a polytech course,
suddenly other ideas are presented as the course content is digested. So a person may start a course and then relise that some other subject is more 
interesting and so a person may open that particular door. 

### I have not meditated before per say. I have meet people that recommend i do, however. I do try to go for a walk for at least an hour in nature so to
speak - for example a local coastal walk. I want to do a walk every day but no time. A walk like this could be considered medatative.

### I have never really mastered anything of consequence. Driving a car is a skill i do have. 

### I am in no way a developer yet. I have found anything to do with programing , very difficult in this course - Including SQL.

### I have 15 tabs open right now, in my browser. 11 study related to 4 not study related. 

### Yes I have had a fight response so far around programing languages and SQL. None so far seem to be intuitive. It feels quite bad and sad. Because it 
seems like maybe I choose the wrong thing to study, but it is something that i have  wanted to try, for some years now. The only way to overcome it is 
if it can be made enjoyable somehow.

### An Intergrated Development Environment , is seems like it is a text editor with added web design capabilities. Coincenently, I have been using 'Brackets'
a little bit. But it seems like Adobe have stopped supporting Brackets?

### The Marshmallow challenge...
