Can't code at all ! still getting multiple synatx errors even when copying exactly from the exercises.
Github seems very difficult to use.
githaub has not saves a few of my posts lately?

    18 August . i liked today's class but found the concepts quite new and a bit challenging.
    Tried to understand the concept of the video recording 'game', also , that concept was out of my grasp?
    Yes , my image
    is definitely more important than my phone. I always want my public image to be nice.
    Images recorded on a phone can be largely controlled to make sure the image is what the image owner wants other people to see versus
    what they would rather people not see. 

        August 22 - I liked todays lecture. I do understand the concept behind using abstract ways to make programing more  - kind of easier to do. However, I really was
        overwhelmed trying to learn SQL and the HTML with CSS, during the data handling and web concepts course. And now trying to pick up Python - well it has proved
        to be very difficult - so all this leads me to be quite apprehensive about whether I can actually complete the two assignments.
