WEEK ONE
Could not be successfull with the 'Scratch' program, but made a small "scratch' that is not complete.

Thus far, i don't think i have discovered much in the way of programing priciples other that the SQL in I.T.5012.
Visual Programing is a way of programing using graphic representations , rather that just writing the code. Visual Programing may help in learning programing, since it instantly displys a visual representation of what the programer is trying to acheive.
My current "Scrath" project can not really be shared since it isn't really working.

WEEK TWO
G.I.T. Taken from Wikipedia - "Git (/ɡɪt/)[8] is software for tracking changes in any set of files". Particularly when writing code for web sites - the author keeps all code in  the GIT software and each times it saves a copy, that copy can be then used to build upon while keeping a copy of the original for refence and incase it is needed to start afresh.
GITHUB, is basically the same , however, there is the added component of being able to share and collaborate on line.
